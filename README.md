* About 
    A burger app, the user inputs a burger that they want to eat which is then added to the 'to eat list' next to a devour button. When the button is clicked it moves the burger to the 'has been eaten' list. All burgers are stored within a Mysql database. 

* Objective 
    - To create a functioning node app that uses a sql database.
    - Demonstrate the mastery of the MVC design model, Mysql queries, ORM, and Handlebars.

* Approach 
    - The challenge was getting the MVC model set up appropriately and have each page importing/exporting to the correct location
    - The next step was making sure that the queries and variables were consistent across all of the pages so that the correct data was flowing into the correct spot.
    - The last step was including the user inputed data via jquery and feeding it into the loop.
